	<h3>$497.00</h3>
	<p>Here is an awesome way to make money: just send me $497 and I have made money! It's so simple, anyone can do it.  Just put one of these PayPal buttons on your site and tell people to click it and whenever they do (and then subsequently fill in their PayPal information, of course), I will make money.  It's a wonderful idea. Please spread the news!</p>
